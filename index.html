    <p style="font-size: 20px">My progress so far on "Line Void" (Title work in progress), a space shmup game. Right now I'm just following a tutorial on YouTube that's teaching me how to make Asteroids, which is why the project is called "Asteroids".
      <p style="font-size: 20px">Currently I'm able to accelerate and rotate the ship. </p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">I'm excited to start working on the ship sprites. Hopefully will be easy to import them into Unity.

    <h2>Monster Hunter GU Save Transfer</h2>
        <p><em>20/08/2024</em></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">This week I made a return to Monster Hunter, one of my all time favourite franchises. Specifically Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, a 1080p high resolution remake of the game originally released on the 3DS. Because the eShop closed down in April, I was unable to make use of the Save data transfer tool that was designed specifically to port your save from the 3DS to the Switch. 
However, I managed to track down a Save Editor online and through a ridiculously laborious process that took me over two days, I managed to get my old save onto the Switch with a little help from my old friend Hex Editor.

    <h2>Game Review</h2>
        <h2>The Typing of the Dead</h2>
        <p><em>01/07/2024</em></p>

        <img src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/340/370463-totd.jpg" alt="Typing of the Dead">

        <p style="font-size: 20px">Maybe you’re a fan of the original games and you’re looking to relive old memories with a new twist. Or maybe, like me, you’re trying to brush up on your typing skills. Either way you look at it The Typing of the Dead is a fast-paced, thrilling adventure back through one of the greatest on-rail shooters that has ever visited the horror genre. It’s a bit jarring at first when you’re thrown into a world of zombies with only your keyboard to protect yourself. But that’s what makes TOTD all the more engaging.
          On a technical level the game runs very smoothly and the inputs have lightning-fast response time which makes laying out zombies with your trusty keyboard all the more enjoyable. Typing out words or phrases to dispatch zombies adds an unexpectedly satisfying layer of challenge and skill. The game cleverly integrates its typing mechanics into the familiar on-rails shooting format, requiring quick thinking and accurate typing under pressure.
          I found that some of the boss fights were quite challenging in the later stages.  These encounters require not only typing speed but also strategic thinking, as each boss presents unique patterns and weaknesses. It’s a refreshing twist on traditional boss battles, where victory hinges on how well you can type out commands while dodging attacks. The Typing of the Dead retains the eerie and atmospheric settings of its predecessor, maintaining a dark and suspenseful tone throughout. The environments are well-designed, immersing you in haunted locales filled with hordes of the undead. The animations are fluid, and the character models are appropriately grotesque.</p>
   
    
    <h2>Hiking through Japan: Kumano Kodo</h2>
    <p><em>01/06/2024</em></p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">Japan is a land of contrasts, where bustling cities seamlessly blend with serene natural landscapes and ancient traditions coexist with modern innovation. Recently, I had the opportunity to embark on a transformative journey along the Kumano Kodo trail, an ancient pilgrimage route nestled deep in the mystical Kii Mountains of the Kii Peninsula. This adventure not only tested my physical endurance but also enriched my spirit with the profound cultural and spiritual heritage of Japan.

      A Path Through History and Spirituality
      
      The Kumano Kodo trail is not just a hiking route; it is a path steeped in history and spirituality. For over a thousand years, pilgrims, including emperors and commoners alike, have traversed these sacred paths to reach the three grand shrines known collectively as the Kumano Sanzan: Kumano Hongu Taisha, Kumano Nachi Taisha, and Kumano Hayatama Taisha. Each shrine is nestled in a different part of the Kii Mountains, surrounded by lush forests, pristine rivers, and tranquil waterfalls.
      
      My Journey Begins
      
      My journey on the Kumano Kodo trail started in the town of Tanabe, where I received my pilgrimage passport, or "Nokyocho," a traditional booklet used to collect unique stamps from each shrine visited along the way. This simple act connected me to centuries of pilgrims who had walked these paths before me, seeking spiritual enlightenment and purification.
      
      Nature's Splendor and Serenity
      
      As I hiked through dense cedar forests and across moss-covered stone paths, I was struck by the profound serenity and natural beauty that enveloped me. The sounds of chirping birds and babbling brooks provided a soothing soundtrack to my journey, while the scent of cedar and earth grounded me in the present moment. Along the way, I encountered picturesque oji shrines, small temples dedicated to local deities, where I paused to offer prayers and reflect on the significance of my pilgrimage.
      
      Encounters with Tradition and Hospitality
      
      One of the highlights of my hike was staying in traditional Japanese minshuku (guesthouses) and ryokan (inns) along the trail. These accommodations not only provided much-needed rest but also immersed me in Japanese hospitality and culture. I enjoyed delicious, locally sourced meals, including delicate sashimi and nourishing bowls of udon, prepared with care by my hosts. The warm futon beds and soothing hot spring baths offered a welcome respite after a day of hiking.
      
      Spiritual Reflections at Kumano Sanzan
      
      Reaching the Kumano Sanzan was a culmination of both physical and spiritual achievement. Each shrine offered a unique atmosphere and a chance for introspection. At Kumano Nachi Taisha, I stood in awe of Japan's tallest waterfall, Nachi no Taki, which cascades dramatically into a serene pool below. At Kumano Hongu Taisha, I marveled at the majestic Oyunohara, a vast sandbar where the shrine's torii gate stands proudly amidst the surrounding mountains.
      
      Conclusion: A Transformational Experience
      
      Walking the Kumano Kodo trail was more than just a hike; it was a journey of self-discovery and cultural immersion. The tranquil beauty of the Kii Mountains, combined with the rich spiritual history of the Kumano region, left an indelible mark on my soul. As I completed my pilgrimage and received the final stamp in my Nokyocho, I felt a profound sense of accomplishment and gratitude for having experienced Japan's spiritual heart in such a profound way.
      
      If you're seeking a journey that combines physical challenge with spiritual enrichment, I highly recommend embarking on the Kumano Kodo trail. Whether you're a seasoned hiker or a cultural enthusiast, this ancient pilgrimage route offers a rare opportunity to connect with Japan's past, present, and natural beauty in a deeply meaningful way.</p>

      <h2>Movie Review</h2>
    <h2><em>An American Werewolf in London</em></h2>
    <p><em>12/10/2023</em></p>
<p>
      <img src="https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/an-american-werewolf-in-london-traces-its-roots-to-a-1940s-monster-movie-classic/intro-1664645354.jpg?s=200" alt="Jack and David at The Slaughtered Lamb"
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">John Landis's "An American Werewolf in London" is a timeless classic that merges horror and dark comedy with groundbreaking special effects. Released in 1981, this film remains a standout in the werewolf genre, known for its innovative use of transformation effects by Rick Baker, which earned him the first Academy Award for Best Makeup.<p></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">The story follows two American backpackers, David (played by David Naughton) and Jack (played by Griffin Dunne), who encounter a horrifying creature while hiking across the English countryside. Jack is killed by the creature, and David wakes up in a London hospital to discover he is now cursed to become a werewolf.<p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px">The film's strength lies in its ability to blend horror with humor seamlessly. Landis deftly navigates between moments of genuine tension and absurdity, creating an atmosphere that keeps the audience on edge while also allowing for moments of dark comedy. The interactions between David and the increasingly decomposed ghost of Jack provide much of the film's humor, serving as both comic relief and a chilling reminder of David's impending doom.<p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px">Rick Baker's makeup and special effects work in "An American Werewolf in London" remains unparalleled even by today's standards. The werewolf transformation scene, in particular, is a masterclass in practical effects, as David painfully contorts and changes into a creature of nightmares. The visceral nature of the transformation, combined with David's desperate attempts to come to terms with his new reality, evokes both sympathy and terror.<p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px">Beyond its technical achievements, the film also explores deeper themes of identity, guilt, and the consequences of one's actions. David's struggle with his newfound monstrous nature serves as a metaphor for the loss of innocence and the darker aspects of humanity that lie within us all.<p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px">In addition to the compelling performances by Naughton and Dunne, Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine deliver strong supporting roles, grounding the fantastical elements of the story in a believable reality.<p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px">"An American Werewolf in London" remains a must-watch for horror enthusiasts and film buffs alike, not only for its groundbreaking effects but also for its ability to blend scares with laughs and its exploration of deeper themes. It's a film that has stood the test of time and continues to influence the horror genre to this day, making it a true classic in every sense.<p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px"><em></em>Rating: 4.5/5<em></em><p></p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 20px"</p>"An American Werewolf in London" is a rare gem that successfully marries horror, comedy, and pathos, offering a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.</p>

        <h2><strong>The Bus Driver</strong></h2>
        <p></p><em>22/06/2022</em></p>
  
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Reggie, a bus driver and an alcoholic is finishing his route for the night and stops for a pint on his way home at his usual pub: The Silver Moon Inn. He starts talking to an old man who he’s never seen before. The old man remarks on his bus driver uniform, and says he used to be a bus driver a long time ago, in outer space. He regales Reggie with stories about his trips through outer space and tells him that he’s from the moon. He shows him a bus drivers licence made of cardboard with his intergalactic credentials on it. Reggie doesn’t believe the old man of course, thinking he’s probably just a drunken senile old man. As he leaves the pub, he spots the old man down the street. The old man turns and winks at Reggie before he transforms into a cloud of stars and soars towards the moon.
          The next day Reggie is driving his usual route and glances down at his bottle of bourbon in the drivers’ compartment, clinking away, before continuing on his journey.</p>
          
          <p style="font-size: 20px"><strong>At the pub</strong></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Reggie sits alone in a booth, looking around the pub at the various goings-ons. Some teenagers playing pool, old people on the slot machines. </p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Mind if I join you?”</p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Reggie looks up and sees an old man. He says he doesn’t mind as he is lonely and the old man seems harmless and might make for interesting conversation.<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Sure.”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“You a bus driver?”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“What gave it away?” (He’s in uniform)<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">The old man laughs and sits down in the booth opposite him.<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“I used tae be a bus driver once, ye see a lot of faces”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Yeah” he chuckles politely<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Which routes are you oan?”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Black rock through Brighton is my usual”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Oooh I’ve been to black rock, lovely spot for fishing”<p></p>
          
          <p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px"><em>There’s a foreboding silence between the two.</em><p></p>
          <p></p>
  
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“...Do you fish?”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Pardon me, son?”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“I said are you fisherman?”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“No, you asked me if I fish. I do fish, but I’m no a fisher man”.<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Oh right…” he takes a sip of his pint.<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“I’m a bus driver like you. Ooohhh I’ve been all over… long time ago mind you sonny”.<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Reggie looks down at the floor and smiles. He feels a strange warmth and connection with the stranger. Usually the pub is filled with regulars he’s seen a million times before, but he’s never seen this old man and it made him curious.<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“I’ve never seen you here before, where abouts are you from?”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Oh no, I’m no fae ‘roond here son, I just come down to wet ma lips every so often and blather wi the locals”<p></p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">“Well it was nice talking to ye, I better head oaf, my supper will getting cold hehe.”<p></p>
          __________________________________________________________________________________
          
          <p style="font-size: 20px"> Reggie sits slightly mesmerized by the mysterious old man and takes another sip of his beer.
          He notices the old man left his wallet on the seat. He picks it up and looks inside, finding his driver’s licence.<p></p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px"> He rushes out to see if he can catch the old man and spots him outside, standing next to a darkly coloured bus that glows in the moonlight. The old man pauses for a moment before getting in, turns around with a smile and winks at Reggie before climbing into the driver's seat and taking off towards the moon.
          The next day Reggie is back driving the bus, still in disbelief from what he saw the night before. He looks down at his bottle of bourbon in the driver’s compartment before continuing on his route.<p></p>

          <h2>James and the Hardware store </h2>

          <p style="font-size: 20px">

James put his key in the ignition and stepped his foot down on the accelerator. It was only four o’clock, the shop didn’t close until five. He still had plenty of time. James had been building a coffee table for his girlfriend for her birthday. He’d spent all morning in the back yard hammering away. The only problem was that now he had run out of screws. He was just a few shy. But her birthday was very fast approaching. It was tomorrow in fact. He should’ve headed down to the hardware store this morning but he was busy mowing the lawn, now he was racing through the traffic on the freeway to get to the only shop in town before it closed. 
He arrived with only fifteen minutes to spare. This wasn’t just a regular hardware store. It’s one of those shops that’s got everything. An emporium you might say. One of those shops that you can go in and ask for a door stop, or a pack of cards, or a fancy dress wig. Whatever you need, they’ve got it. James stepped through the automatic doors. He had planned to ask the shopkeeper where the screws were right away, but he was busy serving another customer. There was a line of about ten people, all queued up with their items and shoving out the door trying to get home. 
‘Just hurry up and get your screws and get out’ James thought.
He stood gazing vacuously at the dozens of aisles in front of him. He thought it would be wise not to get the shopkeepers attention, in case he told him there wasn’t enough time left and asked him to get out. So, he crept down one of the aisles and started looking around. He took a left, then a right, then another left. The place was a labyrinth. It was packed full of all sorts. Surrounding him was a cacophony of sunglass racks, birthday party supplies, imported goods and knick-knacks that he’d only ever noticed peripherally but never taken the time to acknowledge. 
‘Is there anybody back there? We’re closing!’ He heard the shopkeeper shout.
James was silent. He knew if he told the shopkeeper he was back here he might be asked to leave. He hadn’t come all this way and gone through all this effort to back out now. Besides it was his girlfriend’s birthday tomorrow and there was no way he could face her without something to show for it. No, he was leaving with a pack of screws… 
…One way or another.


Ten minutes had passed. James had got so turned around in the clutter of objects in the shop, he had completely lost track of time. An acute ache in his head was beginning to make itself known, a pressure like he had been wearing a cap that was far too tight. He hadn’t even come close to finding the screws and now he would have to go and face the shopkeeper, who would certainly not be happy to see him. Hopefully he hadn’t locked the till yet. James got to the front of the shop. There was nobody there. 


James stood pathetically at the counter for a few moments.
‘Hello?’ he called out to an empty room.
The distant cry of church bells echoed through the building.
‘Hello?’ he repeated with an added note of worry in his voice.
Had they locked the shop with him in it? Impossible, he thought. He tried to see if he could spot an alarm to tell if the shopkeeper had switched them on, but he couldn’t see any. Then he walked up to sliding doors and waved his hand in front of the sensor. They wouldn’t open either. He peered out through the glass at the pitch-black sky. He thought he could see a car pulling out onto the freeway somewhere in the distance.
‘Christ, it had got dark quickly’ he thought.
Then a sickening feeling came over him as he grasped what he was looking at. He wasn’t staring at the night sky over a dimly lit car park. He was staring at the inside of the store’s shutters. The pain in his head came back again, in full force this time; a sharp stabbing pain. He thought about calling the police. Or maybe his girlfriend. No, he couldn’t do that, he would never hear the end of it. It would totally ruin her birthday and then he would be in her bad graces for a very long time. It would take years of apologies and breakfasts in bed to crawl his way back from something like that.
‘Maybe there’s a spare key somewhere behind the front desk’ he exclaimed out loud.
He felt the old timber walls closing in around him. He walked up beside the register and looked around to see if there were any security cameras. There was one right above the counter, and he mimed at it as if he was unlocking a door to signal that he was just looking for a key, and not trying to rob the place. He began rummaging through drawers and turning the place upside down. There was no key to be found anywhere. Nothing in any of the cabinets and nothing in the drawers. 
Then he spotted something: a small bin box with a lock on the side. He reckoned there would be a good chance there would be a spare key in there or something that might help him get out of here. He just had a feeling; James often proved quite the psychic in high-pressure situations like this. He tried to jimmy it open with his pocket knife but no luck. And then… Yes! It was working, it was coming loose! He thought he saw something shimmering inside. There was enough space for his fingers to get in now. He wedged himself between the counter and the back wall, and squatted down with his knees above his head. He placed his foot against the desk, and kicked with all his strength. The drawer flew open and James was sent flying backwards with a terrible thud against the wall.
There were spots of light against a grey static-y background. Sunshine was pouring in through the curtains of the hospital window as James lay in the stretcher, his head wrapped in bandages. The pain in his head was no longer there and he felt a strange warmth surrounding him. His eyes opened slowly and drifted up towards his girlfriend, who was standing next to the bed looking down at him with a scowl on her face, her arms folded.
‘Happy birthday baby’ he chuckled.

It’s like Elden Ring, but purplier.

pFromSoftware has always walked the tightrope between punishing difficulty and transcendent joy. With emElden Ring Nightreignem, they’ve turned up the speed, and invited squads of three to tango in the dark. The result is a bold experiment familiar Dark Souls combat and stylistic trappings, but compressed into a roguelike multiplayer format that rarely gives you a moment to breathe. It’s thrilling, occasionally frustrating, sometimes dazzling — and it works, for the most part.p

pemNightreignem is not a full sequel or traditional DLC. It’s more of a spin-off title. It exists in a parallel reality of the Lands Between — Limveld — that shares many visuals, monsters, and ideas with emElden Ringem. You play as Nightfarers, preset heroes (six at first, expanding to eight), each with unique kits rather than building from scratch. Exploration is dialed back; instead, the focus is on fast, tactical decision-making, loot, and surviving three in-game days before facing off with the final boss — The Nightlord.p

pOne of emNightreign’sem biggest departures from classic Dark Souls pacing is its urgency. Movement and combat feels familiar — you still dodge, roll, and manage stamina — but there’s a constant fear that it could all be over at any moment. If you like methodical exploration and leisurely inventory management, this is the opposite of emElden Ringem.p

pThat said, it’s still an interesting game. There’s enough new content to warrant the price tag, and some old bosses have been given a fresh new twist. Repetition does creep in after several runs, since there’s only one main map and limited mini-bosses and castles.p

pMeta-progression comes through Relics and permanent upgrades unlocked between runs. While not as deep as emElden Ring’sem build system, they feel meaningful enough, and some relic effects are fun to experiment with.p

pThe option to play solo exists, but co-op elevates the experience. Different Nightfarer roles — tank, damage dealer, support — really matter in tougher fights, especially in “Deep of Night” endgame content. Solo runs are viable, but it’s clear the design favours group play.p

pTrue to FromSoftware heritage, emNightreignem doesn’t skimp on atmosphere. Landscapes are glorious, creatures horrifying, and magic wondrously colourful. Twisted versions of Limgrave deliver well, while music and boss themes punctuate tension. Performance is solid on modern hardware, though hectic battles sometimes cause frame dips.p

pStill, variety is a weak point. Camps, enemies, and layouts repeat too often, dulling the experience. Certain bosses can feel unfairly harsh and punishing for newcomers. And in a game so reliant on teamwork, bad random teammates or unlucky loot can ruin a run.p

pFans of emElden Ring’sem deep build customization may also feel restricted. If you loved the open-world freedom, emNightreign’sem constraints might feel too tight.p

h3Verdicth3
pemElden Ring Nightreignem is not emElden Ringem. It doesn’t try to be. It’s a furious, fast-paced roguelike co-op distilled from FromSoftware’s purest DNA. For those who embrace speed, risk, and repetition, it delivers high payoff — moments of triumph, dynamic boss fights, and plenty of loot. For others, the lack of depth and variety may leave a sour aftertaste.p

Playing with friends is the best experience, while random matchmaking can be frustrating.p

    Melbourne’s oldest internet café celebrates it's 25th birthday.
  h2
pem14082025emp
      img src=httpsi.imgur.com42c1Isi.jpeg width=50%
        height=auto
        pIt’s estimated there are over 20,000 internet cafés worldwide, with 65 in Melbourne. Among them, Cydus stands out. First opened in 2000, it is the longest-running internet café in the city — and it’s about to celebrate it's 25th birthday.p

        pBut before we leap into celebrations, a quick look at the history of internet cafés...p
      
        pOriginally designed as places to meet friends, surf the web, and enjoy a cup of coffee, internet cafés have since become increasingly game-focused.p

        pWhen they first appeared, most people had no way of checking their emails outside of homes and offices. The introduction of free web-based services like Hotmail sent their popularity soaring.p

        pPCs nowadays are the undisputed champions of modern hardware, capable of processing billions of instructions per second and rendering immense, detailed environments at lightning-fast speeds. Enough to do your taxes, map the human genome, and be home in time for dinner.p

        pIn Melbourne, internet cafés are a nexus for late-night activity and rambunctious outings with friends. Often open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, they provide respite from the bustling pubs and clubs usually associated with a night on the town. For many, they are like a home away from home.p

        pem“It’s a great place to unwind. I come here at least once a week” said Henry Li, a teenager who travelled to Cydus from Brunswick. “Elden Ring Nightrein is awesome — every decision counts, and the stakes are high. But it’s also a really beautiful world to explore.”emp

        pCydus has been open for 25 years. After two and a half decades of being open to the public, this is what owner Michael Chan had to say about his businessp

        pem“When we first started, people came in just to check emails or browse the web. Now it’s all about gaming, and the social side of it. People come here because they want to share that experience.”emp

        pVideo games are often painted as an anti-social pastime. There is some truth to the stereotype, but Cydus’s history suggests otherwise.p

        pem“Internet cafés actually bring people together,” Chan said. “You might be sitting next to someone you’ve never met, but you end up on the same team and walk out as friends. That doesn’t happen when you’re playing alone at home.”emp

        pOver 25 years, Chan has watched his customer base expand and evolve. “Our demographic is wide. We get uni students after lectures, people coming in after work, and groups of friends meeting up late at night. It’s become a second home for a lot of people.”p

        pCydus regularly updates its PCs and offers deals for regulars, something Chan sees as crucial to staying relevant. “Other cafés can feel transactional. Here, we run competitions, host events, and make sure the place feels welcoming. That’s what keeps people coming back.”p

        pFrom email terminals to eSports hubs, Cydus has endured by adapting to change while keeping its doors open to the community. And according to Chan, the mission hasn’t changed.p

        pem“As long as people love gaming together in the same space, cafés like this will survive,” he said.emp

pSummer Game Fest 2025 just aired with an exciting flurry of game announcements. Here are some of the games that we're most excited for p

        pstrongSonic Racing Cross Worldsstrongbr
Sonic returns to the track with a chaotic new twist. emCross Worldsem merges high-speed racing with multiverse mechanics, throwing characters from different Sonic timelines into neon-soaked circuits that warp mid-race. With a mix of classic drift-heavy kart racing and dimension-bending hazards, it’s one of the most visually ambitious Sonic spin-offs to date.p

pstrongLego Voyagersstrongbr
A fresh IP from the Lego games team, emLego Voyagersem trades traditional brick-breaking for galaxy-spanning exploration. It’s an open-world sci-fi adventure where players build and pilot customizable starships, recruit quirky crew members, and visit procedurally-generated planets. The tone is lighthearted, but the scope is surprisingly vast.p

pstrongMina the Hollowerstrongbr
Yacht Club’s retro love letter to Game Boy Color action titles is finally nearing release. emMina the Hollowerem blends gothic horror with fast-paced top-down combat, featuring tight dungeons, whip-based action, and a moody chiptune soundtrack. It looks and plays like a lost classic, with all the polish of modern design.p

pstrongStranger Than Heavenstrongbr
This mysterious new narrative game from Annapurna had one of the most talked-about trailers at SGF. Blending surreal dreamscapes, romantic drama, and light puzzle mechanics, emStranger Than Heavenem looks like a spiritual successor to emWhat Remains of Edith Finchem—but weirder, more experimental, and unapologetically emotional.p

pstrongResident Evil 9strongbr
Capcom pulls back the curtain on emResident Evil 9em, the chilling conclusion to the Winters saga. Set in a cursed island off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, the game leans into psychological horror, with new enemies inspired by urban legends and folklore. The gameplay looks slower and more atmospheric than emRE Villageem, but no less terrifying.p

        pI've added some different-coloured Sanwa buttons to my 8BitDo Xbox Arcade Stick!! I picked these up the last time I was in Japan and they look and feel great. Definitely an improvement over the original buttons.p
        pThe replacement was fairly simple and just involved unscrewing the base plate and unplugging the old buttons. I took me longer than I expected to find the correct size screwdriver though haha.p

      p style=font-size 20pxNintendo has officially announced the Nintendo Switch 2, set to launch on June 5, 2025, with a starting price of $449.99 AUD. This next-generation hybrid console builds upon the success of its predecessor, introducing significant hardware upgrades and new features designed to enhance the gaming experience.p
p style=font-size 20pxThe Switch 2 boasts a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD touchscreen with HDR10 support and a 120Hz refresh rate, offering sharper visuals and smoother gameplay. Powered by a custom Nvidia Tegra processor, the console supports 4K resolution when docked, providing a substantial performance boost over the original Switch.p
p style=font-size 20pxStorage capacity has been increased to 256GB, expandable via microSD Express cards. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth support, ensuring faster and more stable connections. The console also features improved battery life, catering to gamers on the go.p
p style=font-size 20pxThe new Joy-Con 2 controllers attach magnetically and introduce optical mouse-sensor functionality, allowing for precise control in compatible games. These controllers also support a new feature called GameChat, enabling voice and video communication during gameplay.p
p style=font-size 20pxAt launch, the Switch 2 will be accompanied by titles such as Mario Kart World. The console maintains backward compatibility with most Nintendo Switch games, ensuring a seamless transition for existing users. Additionally, select titles will receive performance enhancements when played on the new hardware.p
p style=font-size 20pxPre-orders for the Switch 2 began on April 24, 2025, and were met with overwhelming demand, leading to rapid sellouts and website crashes at major retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop. Nintendo has implemented an invitation-based pre-order system through the My Nintendo Store, prioritizing users with active Nintendo Switch Online memberships and significant playtime history. Despite these measures, the company has acknowledged potential delays in order fulfillment due to high demand.p
p style=font-size 20pxThe standard Switch 2 is priced at $449.99 AUD, while a bundle including Mario Kart World is available for $499.99 AUD. Accessory prices have seen increases, attributed in part to new tariffs affecting manufacturing costs.p
p style=font-size 20pxThe Nintendo Switch 2 represents a significant advancement in hybrid gaming, offering enhanced performance, innovative features, and a huge game library. While pre-order challenges persist, the console's launch is primed to be a major event in gaming this year.p

      pem20082024emp
      p
        This week I made a return to Monster Hunter, one of my all time favourite
        franchises. Specifically Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, a 1080p high
        resolution remake of the game originally released on the 3DS. Because the
        eShop closed down in April, I was unable to make use of the Save data
        transfer tool that was designed specifically to port your save from the 3DS
        to the Switch. However, I managed to track down a Save Editor online and
        through a ridiculously laborious process that took me over two days, I
        managed to get my old save onto the Switch with a little help from my old
        friend Hex Editor. In summary, cross-platform save transfers are a nightmare.

      p
        Maybe you’re a fan of the original games and you’re looking to relive old
        memories with a new twist. Or maybe, like me, you’re trying to brush up on
        your typing skills.
      p

      p
        Either way you look at it, emThe Typing of the Deadem is a fast-paced,
        thrilling adventure back through one of the greatest on-rail shooters to
        ever hit the horror genre.
      p

      p
        It’s a bit jarring at first when you’re thrown into a world of zombies with
        only your keyboard to protect yourself. But that’s what makes emThe Typing of the Deadem all the
        more engaging.
      p

      p
        On a technical level, the game runs very smoothly and the inputs have
        lightning-fast response time, which makes laying out zombies with your
        trusty keyboard all the more enjoyable.
      p

      p
        Typing out words or phrases to dispatch zombies adds an unexpectedly
        satisfying layer of challenge and skill. The game cleverly integrates its
        typing mechanics into the familiar on-rails shooting format, requiring
        quick thinking and accurate typing under pressure.
      p

      p
        I found that some of the boss fights were quite challenging in the later
        stages. These encounters require not only typing speed but also strategic
        thinking, as each boss presents unique patterns and weaknesses.
      p

      p
        It’s a refreshing twist on traditional boss battles, where victory hinges
        on how well you can type out commands while dodging attacks.

p style=font-size 20pxJohn Landis's An American Werewolf in London is a timeless classic that merges horror and dark comedy with groundbreaking special effects. Released in 1981, this film remains a standout in the werewolf genre, known for its innovative use of transformation effects by Rick Baker, which earned him the first Academy Award for Best Makeup.pp

p style=font-size 20pxThe story follows two American backpackers, David (played by David Naughton) and Jack (played by Griffin Dunne), who encounter a horrifying creature while hiking across the English countryside. Jack is killed by the creature, and David wakes up in a London hospital to discover he is now cursed to become a werewolf.pp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxThe film's strength lies in its ability to blend horror with humor seamlessly. Landis deftly navigates between moments of genuine tension and absurdity, creating an atmosphere that keeps the audience on edge while also allowing for moments of dark comedy. The interactions between David and the increasingly decomposed ghost of Jack provide much of the film's humor, serving as both comic relief and a chilling reminder of David's impending doom.pp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxRick Baker's makeup and special effects work in An American Werewolf in London remains unparalleled even by today's standards. The werewolf transformation scene, in particular, is a masterclass in practical effects, as David painfully contorts and changes into a creature of nightmares. The visceral nature of the transformation, combined with David's desperate attempts to come to terms with his new reality, evokes both sympathy and terror.pp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxBeyond its technical achievements, the film also explores deeper themes of identity, guilt, and the consequences of one's actions. David's struggle with his newfound monstrous nature serves as a metaphor for the loss of innocence and the darker aspects of humanity that lie within us all.pp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxIn addition to the compelling performances by Naughton and Dunne, Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine deliver strong supporting roles, grounding the fantastical elements of the story in a believable reality.pp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxAn American Werewolf in London remains a must-watch for horror enthusiasts and film buffs alike, not only for its groundbreaking effects but also for its ability to blend scares with laughs and its exploration of deeper themes. It's a film that has stood the test of time and continues to influence the horror genre to this day, making it a true classic in every sense.pp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxememRating 4.55emempp
  
  p style=font-size 20pxAn American Werewolf in London is a rare gem that successfully marries horror, comedy, and pathos, offering a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.p

          p style=font-size 20pxReggie, a bus driver and an alcoholic is finishing his route for the night and stops for a pint on his way home at his usual pub The Silver Moon Inn. He starts talking to an old man who he’s never seen before. The old man remarks on his bus driver uniform, and says he used to be a bus driver a long time ago, in outer space. He regales Reggie with stories about his trips through outer space and tells him that he’s from the moon. He shows him a bus drivers licence made of cardboard with his intergalactic credentials on it. Reggie doesn’t believe the old man of course, thinking he’s probably just a drunken senile old man. As he leaves the pub, he spots the old man down the street. The old man turns and winks at Reggie before he transforms into a cloud of stars and soars towards the moon.
          The next day Reggie is driving his usual route and glances down at his bottle of bourbon in the drivers’ compartment, clinking away, before continuing on his journey.p
          
          p style=font-size 20pxstrongAt the pubstrongp
          p style=font-size 20pxReggie sits alone in a booth, looking around the pub at the various goings-ons. Some teenagers playing pool, old people on the slot machines. p
          p style=font-size 20px“Mind if I join you”p
          p style=font-size 20pxReggie looks up and sees an old man. He says he doesn’t mind as he is lonely and the old man seems harmless and might make for interesting conversation.pp
          p style=font-size 20px“Sure.”pp
          p style=font-size 20px“You a bus driver”pp
          p style=font-size 20px“What gave it away” (He’s in uniform)pp
          p style=font-size 20pxThe old man laughs and sits down in the booth opposite him.pp
          p style=font-size 20px“I used tae be a bus driver once, ye see a lot of faces”pp
          p style=font-size 20px“Yeah” he chuckles politelypp

          p style=font-size 20px“Oh right…” he takes a sip of his pint.pp
          p style=font-size 20px“I’m a bus driver like you. Ooohhh I’ve been all over… long time ago mind you sonny”.pp
          p style=font-size 20pxReggie looks down at the floor and smiles. He feels a strange warmth and connection with the stranger. Usually the pub is filled with regulars he’s seen a million times before, but he’s never seen this old man and it made him curious.pp
          p style=font-size 20px“I’ve never seen you here before, where abouts are you from”pp
          p style=font-size 20px“Oh no, I’m no fae ‘roond here son, I just come down to wet ma lips every so often and blather wi the locals”pp

          p style=font-size 20px Reggie sits slightly mesmerized by the mysterious old man and takes another sip of his beer.
          He notices the old man left his wallet on the seat. He picks it up and looks inside, finding his driver’s licence.pp

The old man pauses for a moment before getting in, turns around with a smile and winks at Reggie before climbing into the driver's seat and taking off towards the moon.
          The next day Reggie is back driving the bus, still in disbelief from what he saw the night before. He looks down at his bottle of bourbon in the driver’s compartment before continuing on his route.pp
